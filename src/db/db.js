  "comment1_p1" :"Absolutely wonderful! I've always had a hard time getting my hair to grow out as it never seems to get as long. ",
  "comment1_p2" :"This was probably because it grows out really thin and ends up breaking when I try to comb or straighten. I pretty much gave up and ignored all hopes of having a full and lush head of hair. ",
  "comment1_p3" :"After trying our Hair flame, it has all changed. My hair is growing out longer, thicker and I particularly liked the fact that it doesn't break and isn't quite as brittle anymore. I would definitely recommend.",
